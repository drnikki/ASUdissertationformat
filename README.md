## this is the original readme from the ASU format wizard...
We've used this for about a half-dozen Ph. D. dissertations. The current files pass the format requirements  in spring 2013.

Please contribute your own corrections. By sharing this we are making things easier for all students using  LaTeX for the dissertations at ASU.

To see an example of a dissertation formatted using these LaTeX style files,  click [here](http://www.public.asu.edu/~jelynn/dis.pdf).

Feel free to email john.shumwayjr@gmail.com if you are a graduating ASU student with LaTeX questions.

## Additionally:
I created this repo because several things were missing, and several others were not quite right.

First - I moved nearly ALL text to includes so that the main `.tex` file is just commands.  Even having the acknowledgements in that index file was too much for me.

Second - I need a big glossary and list of terms & symbols.  In it's current state, those don't *quite* work.

Third - I wanted to make sure the contents are formatted according to my style guide - APA. So this importantly diverges from the main ASU format wizard in that way.
